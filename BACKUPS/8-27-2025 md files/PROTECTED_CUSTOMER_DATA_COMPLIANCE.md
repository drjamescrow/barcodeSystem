# Protected Customer Data Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines how the Indie Uprising Print-on-Demand app complies with Shopify's Protected Customer Data requirements to access order and fulfillment data.

## Data Access Level Required
**Level 1** - We require access to customer data excluding direct personal identifiers, specifically:
- Order information (order IDs, line items, quantities)
- Fulfillment information (fulfillment orders, shipping status)
- Product selections and customizations

We do NOT require Level 2 access (names, addresses, emails, phones) as we only access these temporarily through the API for shipping labels and do not store them.

## Compliance Implementation

### Level 1 Requirements Met

#### 1. Data Minimization ✅
- We only access order and fulfillment data necessary for print-on-demand processing
- Customer PII is accessed only when creating shipping labels, never stored
- No analytics or profiling performed on customer data

#### 2. Transparency ✅
- Privacy policy available at: `/privacy-policy`
- Clear documentation of data usage in merchant-facing materials
- Data processing purposes clearly stated

#### 3. Purpose Limitation ✅
- Data used exclusively for order fulfillment
- No marketing or secondary uses
- No data sharing with third parties

#### 4. Consent Respect ✅
- We process orders only when merchants explicitly request fulfillment
- No automated processing without merchant action
- Customer preferences inherited from merchant settings

#### 5. Data Sharing Opt-Out ✅
- We do not sell or share customer data
- No data monetization of any kind
- Merchants can delete all data at any time

#### 6. Automated Decision-Making ✅
- No automated decisions affecting customers
- All fulfillment decisions require merchant approval
- Manual review available for any order issues

#### 7. Data Protection Agreements ✅
- Privacy policy established
- Terms of service include data protection clauses
- GDPR processor agreement available

#### 8. Data Retention ✅
- Order data: 90 days maximum
- Print files: 30 days maximum
- Automatic purging of old data
- No indefinite retention

#### 9. Encryption ✅
- TLS/SSL for all API communications
- Database encryption at rest (Render PostgreSQL)
- Secure token storage with bcrypt
- No plaintext storage of sensitive data

## Technical Implementation

### GDPR Webhook Handlers
Implemented three required GDPR webhooks:
1. `/api/webhooks/customers/data_request` - Returns customer data
2. `/api/webhooks/customers/redact` - Removes customer data
3. `/api/webhooks/shop/redact` - Removes all shop data

### Security Measures
- JWT authentication for all admin endpoints
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- HMAC verification for webhooks
- Environment variable protection for secrets
- Separate test/production environments

### Database Schema
- `print_queue` table stores only order IDs and product info
- No customer PII columns
- Shipping addresses stored as JSONB, easily redacted
- Automatic timestamps for retention management

## Required Scopes
The following scopes are required for Level 1 Protected Customer Data:
```
read_products
write_products
read_orders (Protected - Level 1)
