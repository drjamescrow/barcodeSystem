# Order Processing System - Production Readiness TODO List

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. **Debug Code & Console Logs**
- **CRITICAL**: 143 console.log statements found in backend order processing code
- Files affected: server.js (92), debug_client_products.js (18), update_location_gid.js (10), and others
- **Action Required**: Remove ALL console.log statements or use proper structured logging
- **Risk**: Exposes order data, customer information, webhook payloads, and internal logic

### 2. **Webhook Security Vulnerabilities**
- **CRITICAL**: Webhook signature verification can be bypassed (warns but continues)
- Missing proper HMAC validation enforcement
- No rate limiting on webhook endpoints
- Test webhook endpoints exposed without authentication
- **Action Required**: Enforce strict webhook verification, add rate limiting
- **Risk**: Fake order injection, DoS attacks, data manipulation

### 3. **Database Security Issues**
- **CRITICAL**: Raw SQL queries without proper parameterization in some places
- No encryption for sensitive order data (customer emails, addresses)
- Print file URLs stored as plain text (can expire)
- **Action Required**: Audit all SQL queries, encrypt PII, secure file storage
- **Risk**: SQL injection, data breach, GDPR violations

### 4. **Missing Authentication & Authorization**
- No role-based access control for order operations
- Missing API key rotation mechanism
- Session tokens stored insecurely
- **Action Required**: Implement RBAC, secure token management
- **Risk**: Unauthorized order access/modification

## üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY PRODUCTION BLOCKERS

### 5. **Error Handling & Recovery**
- **SEVERE**: No retry mechanism for failed webhook processing
- Missing circuit breaker pattern for external services
- No dead letter queue for failed orders
- Errors not properly logged or monitored
- **Action Required**: Implement robust error recovery system
- **Impact**: Lost orders, manual intervention required

### 6. **Performance & Scalability Issues**
- No connection pooling optimization (basic pool config)
- Missing database query optimization (some indexes but not comprehensive)
- No caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Synchronous processing blocks request handling
- **Action Required**: Implement async processing, optimize queries
- **Impact**: System crashes under load, slow response times

### 7. **Data Integrity Problems**
- Race conditions possible in concurrent order processing
- No transaction management for multi-table operations
- Missing data validation on critical fields
- No audit trail for order modifications
- **Action Required**: Add proper transaction handling and validation
- **Impact**: Data corruption, lost orders, inconsistent state

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING ISSUES FOR PRODUCTION

1. **No webhook security** - Orders can be faked
2. **No error recovery** - Orders will be lost
3. **No testing** - Unreliable system
4. **Performance issues** - Will crash under load
5. **No monitoring** - Blind to problems
6. **Security vulnerabilities** - Data breach risk
7. **No documentation** - Unmaintainable

## üêõ KNOWN BUGS & ISSUES

### Critical Bugs
1. **Webhook verification bypass** - Continues processing even with invalid signature
2. **Race condition** - Concurrent webhooks can create duplicate orders
3. **Memory leak** - Unclosed database connections in error paths
4. **File URL expiration** - Cloudinary URLs expire without refresh
5. **Status transition** - Can set invalid status combinations

### Data Issues
1. **Missing validation** - Can save orders with null required fields
2. **Inconsistent timestamps** - Timezone handling issues
3. **Orphaned records** - Deleted orders leave related records
4. **Cache invalidation** - Stale data served after updates

### Integration Issues
1. **ShipStation** - Only demo mode, no real integration
2. **Shopify sync** - No automatic product sync
3. **Webhook registration** - Fails silently on some errors
4. **GraphQL errors** - Not properly handled or retried

## üìù TECHNICAL DEBT

1. **TODO Comments**: 6 unresolved TODOs in worker.js and server.js
2. **Deprecated APIs**: Still using some REST endpoints instead of GraphQL
3. **Legacy tables**: Old fulfillment_orders table still exists
4. **Hardcoded values**: API URLs and configs hardcoded
5. **Mixed async patterns**: Callbacks, promises, and async/await mixed
6. **No TypeScript**: Type safety issues throughout
7. **Monolithic design**: Everything in server.js (9000+ lines)
