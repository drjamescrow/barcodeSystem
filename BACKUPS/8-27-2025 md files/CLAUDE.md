# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Architecture

This is a **Print on Demand System** for Shopify with three main components:

1. **Backend** (`backend/`) - Node.js/Express API with PostgreSQL database
2. **Shopify App** (`shopify-app/`) - React frontend with Fabric.js canvas design tools
3. **Admin Panel** (`admin-panel/`) - React admin interface for product and order management

### Key Technologies
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary (image storage)
- Frontend: React, Fabric.js (canvas manipulation), Shopify Polaris
- Build Tools: Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Testing: Jest (backend), Vitest (frontend)

## Development Workflow

### Important Development Guidelines
- **Task Completion**: After completing each task on a to-do list, run syntax error checks (linting, type checking) before moving to the next task
- **Testing Strategy**: NO local testing - all testing is done live on Render after pushing to GitHub
- **UI Testing**: Use Playwright with admin dashboard credentials from environment variables:
  - Credentials are stored in Render environment variables
  - Access via: `process.env.TEST_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `process.env.TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  - This allows direct interaction with the live UI for testing and verification

## Common Development Commands

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Install specific components
npm run install:backend
npm run install:frontend
```

### Development Servers (for local development only, not testing)
```bash
# Start backend API server
npm run dev:backend

# Start Shopify app frontend
npm run dev:shopify

# Start admin panel
npm run dev:admin
```

### Syntax Checking & Testing Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check syntax after each task (before committing)
cd backend && node -c server.js

# 2. After pushing to GitHub, ALWAYS:
#    - Wait 2 minutes for Render deployment to complete
#    - Verify deployment status before testing

# Check deployment status via Render MCP
mcp__render__list_deploys --serviceId=srv-d23deo2dbo4c73846dig --limit=1

# Look for:
# - "status": "live" (deployment complete)
# - "finishedAt": timestamp (recently completed)

# 3. Only then proceed with testing
# Testing is done live on Render - no local testing
```

### Building
```bash
# Build all components
npm run build:all

# Build specific components
npm run build:backend
npm run build:frontend
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run database migrations
cd backend && npm run migrate

# Seed database with test data
cd backend && npm run seed
```

## Project Structure

- **Database schema**: `database/schema.sql`
- **API routes**: Defined in `backend/server.js`
- **Canvas designer**: `shopify-app/src/components/FabricDecorator.jsx` (primary design interface)
- **Admin interface**: `admin-panel/src/components/AdminInterface.jsx`
- **Order management**: `admin-panel/src/pages/OrderManagement.jsx`
- **Deployment config**: `deployment/docker-compose.yml`, `render.yaml`

## Key Workflows

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. Client uploads artwork via `/api/upload-artwork` (authenticated)
2. Canvas design data processed with Fabric.js
3. Generate mockups via `/api/generate-mockup` (authenticated)
4. Create print-ready files with accurate positioning

### Product Creation Flow
1. Admin creates base product via admin panel
2. Add variants and print areas through interface
3. Deploy to Shopify store via GraphQL API (2025-07 version)
4. Update existing products via GraphQL mutations
5. Handle orders through webhook `/api/webhooks/orders/create`
6. Process fulfillments via `/api/webhooks/fulfillments/create`

## Environment Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Cloudinary account for image storage
- Shopify Partner account for app development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKERS

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until these critical issues are resolved:
- **Security**: Multiple critical vulnerabilities across all components
- **Console Logs**: 460+ debug statements exposing sensitive data
- **No Testing**: 0% test coverage across entire system
- **Webhook Security**: Can be bypassed, allowing fake orders
- **Authentication**: Missing or insecure across components
- **Error Recovery**: No retry mechanisms, orders will be lost
- **Performance**: Will crash under load, no optimization
- **No Payment System**: Cannot charge merchants or process payments
- **No Billing Integration**: Will fail Shopify app review without proper billing

See the TODO files above for detailed remediation plans.

## Render Platform Integration

Claude Code now has direct access to Render MCP server, enabling direct management of Render services for this project:

### Available Render Operations
- **Service Management**: List, create, and update web services and static sites
- **Database Operations**: Manage PostgreSQL instances and run queries directly
- **Monitoring**: Access logs, metrics (CPU, memory, HTTP requests), and deployment status
- **Environment Variables**: Update service environment variables without manual dashboard access
- **Deployments**: Track deploy status and trigger new deployments

### Common Render Commands via Claude Code
```bash
# View all services
mcp__render__list_services

# Get service logs
mcp__render__list_logs --resource <service-id>

# View service metrics
mcp__render__get_metrics --resourceId <service-id> --metricTypes cpu_usage memory_usage

# Update environment variables
mcp__render__update_environment_variables --serviceId <service-id> --envVars <vars>

# Query PostgreSQL database
mcp__render__query_render_postgres --postgresId <postgres-id> --sql <query>
```

This integration allows for seamless monitoring, debugging, and management of the production infrastructure directly through Claude Code without needing to access the Render dashboard.
