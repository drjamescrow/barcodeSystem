Shopify Fulfillment Service App ‚Äì Project Overview & Technical Documentation

Last updated: 2025-08

üìå Project Purpose

We are building a Shopify Fulfillment Service App that:

Integrates with Shopify via the Fulfillment Service API (GraphQL).

Provides a custom print queue where merchants' fulfillment orders flow in.

Allows admins to manage fulfillment state (accept/reject/cancel/fulfill).

Groups multi-line-item orders under a single fulfillment order in our DB/UI.

Runs on Render with:

A Node/Express backend.

A React frontend (admin panel).

BullMQ workers for background processing.

Redis for job queues and deduplication.

This is not an order management app ‚Äî it does not modify or cancel Shopify orders.
It only responds to fulfillment orders and manages our own fulfillment workflow.

‚öôÔ∏è Current Tech Stack

Shopify API: GraphQL Admin API, schema version 2025-07 (latest stable).

Important: All interactions are via GraphQL only. REST must not be reintroduced.

Node.js 18+ on Render.

PostgreSQL for persistence.

Redis (Render managed) for BullMQ queues and in-memory deduplication.

BullMQ for async workers (slow jobs, retries, rate limiting).

Express backend with:

Webhook verification (verifyShopifyWebhook + HMAC).

Unified webhook handler (/api/webhooks/fulfillment/:action).

Admin API endpoints for the React panel.

React (Vite) frontend.

Helmet CSP configured for embedded Shopify app (via frame-ancestors).

CORS allowlist with Shopify + admin panel origins.

üì° Shopify Webhooks

We subscribe to the following fulfillment lifecycle topics:

fulfillment_orders/fulfill_request

fulfillment_orders/fulfill_request_accepted

fulfillment_orders/fulfill_request_rejected

fulfillment_orders/cancellation_request

fulfillment_orders/cancellation_request_accepted

fulfillment_orders/cancellation_request_rejected

fulfillment_orders/hold

fulfillment_orders/release_hold

fulfillment_orders/moved

Webhook Handler Consolidation

Single route: /api/webhooks/fulfillment/:action

One handler (handleFulfillmentWebhook) processes all simple lifecycle events.

Complex webhooks (request_submitted, order_routed) remain custom, since they require DB writes.

Always return 200 OK within 5s (Shopify requirement).

Deduplication & retries handled via Redis + BullMQ.

üóÉ Database Schema

Two main tables:

fulfillment_orders

Represents a Shopify fulfillment order (one per order per service location).

CREATE TABLE fulfillment_orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  order_name VARCHAR(50),
  fulfillment_order_id VARCHAR(255), -- Shopify GID
  shop_domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255),
  shop_email VARCHAR(255),
  shipping_address JSONB,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  tracking_number VARCHAR(100),
  tracking_company VARCHAR(100),
  tracking_url VARCHAR(500),
  notes TEXT,
  exception_notes TEXT,
  shipped_at TIMESTAMP,
  delivered_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

print_queue_items

Represents line items of each fulfillment order.

CREATE TABLE print_queue_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  fulfillment_order_id INTEGER REFERENCES fulfillment_orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  line_item_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  client_product_id INTEGER REFERENCES client_products(id),
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  artwork_config JSON,
  print_file_url VARCHAR(500),
  mockup_url VARCHAR(500),
  product_title VARCHAR(255),
  variant_details JSONB,
  shopify_product_url VARCHAR(500),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(fulfillment_order_id, line_item_id)
);


Why this structure?

Orders are grouped as a single parent (fulfillment_orders).

Each line item is a child (print_queue_items).

Matches Shopify‚Äôs fulfillment model (fulfillment orders are containers of line items).

Enables single-fulfillment per order with multiple items.

üîÑ Background Processing

Deduplication: Prevents duplicate jobs when Shopify retries webhooks.

BullMQ queues:

webhookQueue ‚Äì all webhook jobs.

shopifyQueue ‚Äì outbound Shopify API mutations (with concurrency = 2.5).

heavyQueue ‚Äì slow tasks like mockup/image generation.

Redis:

Persistent (paid Render plan).

Configured with maxmemory-policy=noeviction (important for BullMQ).

Worker behavior:

Logs concurrency config at startup.

Handles graceful shutdown (SIGTERM).

üîí Security & Compliance

Webhook security:

HMAC verification middleware (X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256).

Shopify shop domain bound to each webhook request.

OAuth scopes (minimized to fulfillment-only):

read_fulfillments

write_fulfillments

read_assigned_fulfillment_orders

write_assigned_fulfillment_orders

read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders

write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders

Privacy compliance:

Currently at Level 1 PII access.

Do not expect customer name in all cases.

Use fulfillmentOrder.destination fields for shipping info.

Fallback to customer_name from order-level only if permitted.

üé® Admin Panel (React)

Order Queue View:

One row per fulfillment order.

Badge for number of items.

Expandable list of items.

Order Details View:

Shows all line items.

Single fulfillment form (tracking/shipping applies to all).

Combined file download for multiple items.

Batch Operations:

Work at the fulfillment order level (not per line item).

Cancelling/fulfilling in bulk applies to all items.

üìã Key Decisions (with rationale)

GraphQL-only (no REST)
Prevents drift, ensures alignment with Shopify 2025+ strategy.

Unified webhook handler
Simplifies maintenance, avoids code duplication.

Queue-based architecture
Ensures 5s webhook SLA compliance, retries, and concurrency control.

Grouped fulfillment orders
Matches Shopify model, reduces shipping complexity/cost.

Deduplication layer
Essential due to Shopify‚Äôs retry mechanism.

No order cancellation
‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù in admin panel ‚Üí reject/close fulfillment request, never cancel Shopify order.

üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Do not confuse:
fulfillmentOrder.destination (shipping info, GraphQL)
vs. order.shipping_address (REST ‚Äî not to be used).

Do not compare location by name.
Always use location GIDs.

Do not return 400/500 to Shopify on webhook errors.
Always return 200 to avoid retries.

Do not use REST endpoints anywhere ‚Äî this project is 100% GraphQL 2025-07.

‚úÖ Current Status

Fulfillment service created & registered in Shopify.

Webhooks subscribed and routed correctly.

Deduplication, BullMQ queues, Redis configured (noeviction).

Database schema migrated to parent/child tables.

Admin panel shows grouped multi-item orders.

Privacy Level 1 compliance (no guaranteed access to customer name).

Render deploys:

backend (Express API).

frontend (React panel).

worker (BullMQ jobs).

üîÆ Next Steps

Improve error dashboards/log visibility in admin.

Expand schema validation with Zod for webhook payloads.

Automate retries & alerting for failed Shopify API mutations.

Build test fixtures with mock Shopify FO payloads for CI validation.
