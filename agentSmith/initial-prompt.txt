use the product-manager agent based on the following app idea: the app is a web app that helps the user create product listings across multiple marketplaces - Shopify, Etsy, and Amazon. it does this by being the single input source of all necessary product info and then either creating downloadable spreadsheets that can be uploaded to the platforms to create the listings, or by creating the listings directly via api. the app will initially be for clothing/apparel sellers, but may expand into more categories in the future.
